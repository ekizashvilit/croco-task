# Task Manager Application

This is a simple task manager application built with React and Vite.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (which includes npm) installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the project files.**

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/croco-task
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Open your terminal in the project root and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server, and you should see output in your terminal indicating the local URL where the application is running (usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar).

5.  **Open the application in your browser:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the project files using ESLint.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.
